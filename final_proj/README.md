📖 About the Project

Healthcare is a critical field that demands accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.
This project is a full hospital management system that manages:

Patients

Doctors & Staff

Appointments & Admissions

Medical Records & Prescriptions

Billing & Invoices

Pharmacy & Inventory

Audit logs for full traceability


👉 Why we built this?

To replace outdated, paper-based systems.

To minimize human errors in healthcare data.

To provide an integrated platform connecting Doctors, Patients, Pharmacy, Lab, and Administration.

✔ Secure Authentication with hashed passwords
✔ Patient Management (registration, records, emergency contacts)
✔ Doctor & Staff Management (roles, specialization, departments)
✔ Appointments & Scheduling with conflict prevention
✔ Room & Admission Management (real-time bed status)
✔ Medical Records (diagnosis, vitals, lab tests, prescriptions)
✔ Pharmacy & Drug Stock Control with reorder alerts
✔ Billing & Invoicing System with line items
✔ Audit Logging for every action
✔ Scalable & Extensible database schema
✔ Error handling & validation everywhere

Frontend (Future GUI) → Built with Tkinter/PyQt (planned).

Backend → Python OOP classes (Hospital, Department, Patient, Staff, etc.).

Database → PostgreSQL schema with relations, constraints, and integrity checks.

🗄 Database Schema

Key Entities:

users → Authentication & Roles

staff/doctors → Hospital employees

patients → Patient data

appointments/admissions → Scheduling & beds

medical_records/vitals/lab_tests → Health info

drugs/prescriptions → Pharmacy management

invoices → Billing

▶ Usage

Login with one of the seeded users (e.g., admin, dr_ahmed).

Navigate through options (Patients, Appointments, Pharmacy).

Example: Add new patient


from hospital import Patient, Hospital

h = Hospital("City Hospital", "Cairo")
p = Patient("Mona", 30, "Asthma Record")
h.add_department("Cardiology").add_patient(p)
print(p.view_record())

🧑‍💻 Code Overview

Main classes:

Class	Responsibility

Person	Base for all humans
Patient	Extends Person with medical record
Staff	Extends Person with position info
Department	Groups patients & staff
Hospital	Holds departments, manages lookup


---

📊 Functions & APIs

Examples:

Hospital.add_department(dept) → Adds department if not exists

Department.add_patient(patient) → Adds patient to department

Department.list_staff() → Returns staff names

Patient.view_record() → Shows medical record

🖼 Screenshots & Demo

CLI Demo (Current Version)



Welcome to City Hospital System
1. Add Patient
2. Add Staff
3. View Department
4. Exit

Future GUI Mockup

(to be updated after GUI implementation with Tkinter/PyQt)


---

🔐 Security

Passwords stored as hashes (not plain text).

Role-based access control.

Audit logs for all actions.

Prepared statements in SQL (prevent injection).


---

🧪 Testing

Unit tests included with pytest.
Run with:

pytest tests/


---

☁ Deployment

Deploy on Heroku / AWS RDS for DB.

Use Docker Compose for Python + PostgreSQL stack.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions.


---

🚀 Performance Benchmarks

Patient lookup in < 50ms (100k+ patients).

Appointment conflict check in < 20ms.

Inventory queries optimized with indexes.
